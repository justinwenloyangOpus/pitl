# Prolonged into the latent
### by Justin Yang

## **Application Notes:**
The score can be accessed at: https://pitl.justinyang.net/
As this is a web browser based score application, it can be run from any device that runs a web browser and is connected to the internet. Some devices may not be powerful enough to run the score or may cause the score to lag.

### **PARTS:**
Any part or combination of parts can be displayed by adjusting arguments in the URL.
Start with: **https://pitl.justinyang.net/**
Add: **?parts=**
Then: Add the parts you would like displayed separated by a semi-colon - **?parts=1;3;9**
Parts are numbered from 0.
For Example: [https://pitl.justinyang.net/?parts=4](https://pitl.justinyang.net/?parts=4) will display the score for player #5
https://pitl.justinyang.net/?parts=0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15 will display the full score with all 16 parts

### **SCORE CONTROLS:**
On-screen score controls are available, normally for the conductor or performance manager.
To display score controls, add this additional text to the URL after the parts: **&controls=yes**
For Example: [https://pitl.justinyang.net/?parts=0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15&controls=yes]( https://pitl.justinyang.net/?parts=0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15&controls=yes) will display the full score and the performance controls.

**Start Button:** This will start the piece for all connected parts. Once **Start** is pressed, the **Pause** and **Stop** buttons will become active and the panel will minimize, disappearing. The panel is accessed again by hovering the mouse in the upper-left corner of the browser window. A white toolbar will appear. Clicking the arrow on the right-hand side of the toolbar will expand the control panel.

**Time Sec:** Enter the time, in seconds, at which you wish to start the piece, then press return/enter on your keyboard, then press the **Start** button to start the piece at that time. Once a time has been entered in the **Time Sec** box and return/enter is pressed, the **Time Sec** box becomes inactive.

**Pause:** Pauses for all connected parts.

**Stop:** Reinitializes the entire piece for all connected parts.

**Ready Indicators/Ready Button:** The P0 - P15 buttons are indicators. Each score that connected without controls, has a ready button. When the ready button is pressed, it will disappear for the client and the appropriate indicator on the control panel will turn green.

**Clock:** There is a hidden clock in the lower-lefthand corner for all connected parts. Hover to get toolbar and click arrow to expand.

## **Performance Notes:**
Pitch changes will be indicated by a flashing turquoise border around the pitch box.
Pitch notations are rounded to the quarter-tone. Therefore, the same pitch may appear in the pitch box but the actual new pitch may be slightly different.
The actual pitch can be heard by tapping/clicking on the pitch box.
### **NOTE:** For chrome users, click anywhere in the grey area to initialize audio.
Pitch changes are not coordinated with the other events in the score. Performers should try to change pitch as soon as possible after a pitch change, but can use discretion in finding an appropriate moment to change pitch. For long sustained events, wait until the next event to change pitch.

Singers can use a standard ‘Ah’ type of phoneme. See Joan La Barbara’s performance of Morton Feldman’s Three Voices for reference.

The individual bricks are short articulations of the indicated pitch.
The animated curves represent crescendos on the indicated pitch.

The animated bricks alternate between magenta and yellow to indicate a new 'mode' or phrase. For example, there are alternations of different tempos. A set of magenta bricks will be in one tempo and the set of yellow bricks that follow will be in another tempo.
